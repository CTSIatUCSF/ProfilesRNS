To create a UCSF version of Profiles:
Run all scripts in here, starting with UCSF_CreateSchema.sql.

It seems you also need to run the scripts in the Crosslinks directory.


Afterwards run the ones in VersionUpgrade_* that are specific to your upgrade or target version, paying attention to any README.txt that is in that directory.

To upgrade an existing UCSF version of Profiles, just run the ones in VersionUpgrade_* that are specific to your upgrade or target version, paying attention to any README.txt that is in that directory.
