<h3 id="who">Who is listed in UCI Profiles?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UCI Profiles was created for research networking so we initially focused on adding UCI faculty members, 
  researchers with academic leadership appointments, and non-faculty academic researchers. </li>
  <li>We are happy to include research staff and other individuals in the UCI community, on request and if possible. 
  Send requests, with full name and employee ID, to <a href="mailto:profiles@uci.edu">profiles@uci.edu</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Who can view UCI Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCI Profiles is searchable on the web and can be viewed by the general public as well as the UCI community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login">How do I sign in to UCI Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong><a href="../login/default.aspx?method=login&amp;edit=true">Sign in</a></strong> link on any UCI Profiles page.
  Then enter your single sign on (SSO) username and password.</li>
  <li>If you have never used SSO, or for password support, go to 
  <a href="https://security.uci.edu/secure-computer/passwords.html" target="_blank">UCI Information Security and Privacy</a> 
  or contact your Home Departmental Administrator.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="pubs">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile? How can I correct this?</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>UCI Profiles uses a complex mix of names, institution, and publication information to find your  publications in PubMed's repository. 
  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to  match all articles in PubMed to Profiles authors with complete precision and accuracy. </li>
  <li>People who have common names, who published under multiple names or whose articles were written while at other 
  institutions are most likely to have incomplete publication lists. </li>
  <li>You can make corrections by searching PubMed from within Profiles to add, edit or delete publications. By curating publications 
  manually, you are helping UCI Profiles to identify which concepts and co-authors are correctly associated with your profile, 
  thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the right publications on subsequent attempts. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage">Who manages UCI Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCI Profiles is managed by the <a href="https://ctsi.ucsf.edu/about-us/programs/research-technology" target="_blank">Research Technology</a> 
  program of UCSF's <a href="http://ctsi.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)</a>.</li>
