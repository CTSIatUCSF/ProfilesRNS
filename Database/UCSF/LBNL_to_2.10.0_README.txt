UCSF\VersionUpgrade_2.x_2.9.0\ExecuteBeforeHarvardScripts all had nothing to do (did not even bother this time)
2.0 to 2.5.1 (these did something, have upgraded schema but not data, skip ORNG table updates section and visibility stuff) 
2.5.1 to 2.6.0 (done, but do not run the section in data where it updates the ORNG..Apps table) 
2.6.0 to 2.7.0 (done) 
2.7.0 to 2.8.0 (done) 
2.8.0 to 2.9.0 (done) 
2.9.0 to 2.10.0 (done) STOP
