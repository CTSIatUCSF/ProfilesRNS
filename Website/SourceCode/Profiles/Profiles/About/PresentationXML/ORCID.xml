<p>Have you ever been confused with someone with a similar name? ORCID might fix that, forever.</p>
<p>	<a target="_blank" href="https://orcid.org" title="ORCID" >ORCID </a> is a new system that gives every researcher a permanent unique ID to make it easy to give them credit for their scholarly workâ€”even if their name changes, or they change institutions. 

	It takes just a few minutes to get an ORCID ID issued. Many journals and granting agencies have already started asking researchers to include their ORCID ID as part of their application process.

	About 1,000 UCSF researchers have already gotten their ORCID IDs. You can see them on the profile pages of people like <a target="_blank" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/coleen.sabatini" title="Coleen Sabatini">Coleen Sabatini </a>
  and <a target="_blank" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/manasi.mayekar" title="Manasi Mayekar">Manasi Mayekar</a>.
