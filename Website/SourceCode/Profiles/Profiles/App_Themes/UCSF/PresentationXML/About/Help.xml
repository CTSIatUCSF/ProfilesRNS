<h3 id="who">Who is listed in UCSF Profiles?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UCSF Profiles was created for research networking so we initially focused on adding UCSF faculty members, researchers 
  with academic leadership appointments, and non-faculty academic researchers.</li>
  <li>We are happy to include research staff and other individuals in the UCSF community, on request and if possible. 
  Send requests, with full name and employee ID, to <a href="mailto:profiles@ucsf.edu">profiles@ucsf.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Who can view UCSF Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCSF Profiles is searchable on the web and can be viewed by the general public as well as the UCSF community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login">How do I sign in to UCSF Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong><a href="../login/default.aspx?method=login&amp;edit=true">Sign in</a></strong> link on any UCSF Profiles page. 
  Then enter your MyAccess username and password.</li>
  <li>If you have never used your MyAccess account, or for password support, go to 
  <a href="https://myaccess.ucsf.edu/" title="Go to the UCSF ITS website" target="_blank">https://myaccess.ucsf.edu/</a> 
  or contact your Home Departmental Administrator.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="pubs">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile? How can I correct this?</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>UCSF Profiles uses a complex mix of names, institution, and publication information to find your publications in PubMed's repository. 
  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to match all articles in PubMed to Profiles authors with complete precision and accuracy.</li>
  <li>People who have common names, who published under multiple names or whose articles were written while at other institutions 
  are most likely to have incomplete publication lists. </li>
  <li>You can make corrections by searching PubMed from within Profiles to add, edit or delete publications. By curating publications 
  manually, you are helping UCSF Profiles to identify which concepts and co-authors are correctly associated with your profile, 
  thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the right publications on subsequent attempts. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage">Who manages UCSF Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCSF Profiles is managed by the <a href="http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/about-us/programs/virtual-home" target="_blank">Research Technology</a> 
  program of UCSF's <a href="http://ctsi.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)</a>.</li>
