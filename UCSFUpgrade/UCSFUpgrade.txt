Backup tables
Upgrade db from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4
skip upgrade data part

upgrade db from 1.04 to 2.0.0 
compare presentation xml

/****** Script for SelectTopNRows command from SSMS  ******/
SELECT PresentationID, PresentationXML 
  FROM [profiles_prod].[Ontology.Presentation].[XML] 
  for XML  auto

Run upgrade with InstallDataUCSF.xml and compare
                -- Presentation
                UPDATE o
                                SET         _SubjectNode = [RDF.].fnURI2NodeID(subject),
                                                _PredicateNode = [RDF.].fnURI2NodeID(predicate),

Move AppRegistry and APpData over, just grab NODEID!

Slowly drop ORNG items and schema!

The instance of the SQL Server Database Engine cannot obtain a LOCK resource at this time. Rerun your statement when there are fewer active users. Ask the database administrator to check the lock and memory configuration for this instance, or to check for long-running transactions.

Fix global health input to point to new ORNG schema and nodeId items

Fix grant import sp to use new ORNG schema

Edit getnewhrandpubs script so that person filters are NOT wiped out!

Remove fix gadget filters from weekly, add to nightly
Remove cleaning of import filter from weekly

Remove MaxCardinality from Overview

NEed to fix RDF..GetStoreNode and [RDF.].[DeleteNode]

Script all ORNG sp,s including old one that have changed!

See if this is needed;
update   [Ontology.].[ClassProperty] set MaxCardinality = 0 where _PropertyLabel = 'Overview'
and Class = 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person';

Think about 
[RDF.].[DeleteTriples] which we created

Add gadget to filter as part of sp to add gadget to ontology

Be very careful in the UCSF to UCSF. schema change. Be sureto hunt down ALL db dependencies, including the one to geneate people IDs

Create ORNG.UCSF schema as well

-- this stuff is real

Install new grant loader
Update Ontology..DataMap to point to [ORGN.UCSF].vwGrant

GetNewHR job has changed, as has the globalheatlh and other gadget ones

Set max cardinality to 1 for overview, see if anyone has 2

PresentationXML for item 4 ----


Release notes

ALTER procedure [RDF.].[DeleteNode]
add custom modules to freetextKeyword in ClassProperty table
