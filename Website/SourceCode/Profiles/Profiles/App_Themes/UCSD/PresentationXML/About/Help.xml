At a minimum, an individual's profile will include the person's name, degrees and basic contact information (sourced from the UCSD Directory). <br /><br /><br /><br />
Profile owners can edit and enhance their own profiles by providing a research overview, a photo, awards, links to other sites, etc. <br /><br /><br /><br />
Any published articles available in PubMed are listed, and Profile owners can add additional publications.

<h3 id="who">Who is listed in UCSD Profiles?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UCSD Profiles was created for research networking so we initially focused on adding UCSD faculty members, 
  researchers with academic leadership appointments, and non-faculty academic researchers. 
<p><span class="notice">Important Note: </span>
If you are a faculty member and your profile page is not found, it is most likely that your title in Blink is not listed 
with your academic faculty title. For example, if you listed your department name as your title in blink, you would have 
to change blink to reflect either Professor, Research Scientists etc. Blink updates have to be initiated either by the UCSD 
employee directly or their home department. Once blink is updated, your profile will be automatically generated with the next refresh cycle.</p>
</li>
  <li>We are happy to include research staff and other individuals in the UCSD community, on request and if possible.</li>
  <li>Profile creation requires that an individual's data be in the UCSD Directory (Blink) and set to be shared with public websites. 
  If you are a UCSD employee and do not have a profile, <a href="mailto:ctri-support@ucsd.edu">request yours now</a> 
  by sending us your UCSD Employee ID.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Who can view UCSD Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCSD Profiles is searchable on the web and can be viewed by the general public as well as the UCSD community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login">How do I sign in to UCSD Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong><a href="../login/default.aspx?method=login&amp;edit=true">Sign in</a></strong> link on any UCSD Profiles page. 
  Then enter your SSO username and password.</li>
  <li>If you have never used SSO or for password support: go to 
  <a href="http://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/access/business-systems/access.html" title="Go to the UCSD Blink website" target="_blank">http://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/access/business-systems/access.html</a> 
  or contact your Home Departmental Administrator.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="pubs">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile? How can I correct this?</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>UCSD Profiles uses a complex mix of names, institution, and manually entered publication information to find your publications 
  in PubMed's repository. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to exactly match all articles in PubMed to UCSD authors with complete 
  precision and accuracy. The algorithm used to find articles from PubMed attempts to minimize the number of publications incorrectly 
  added to a profile; however, this method may result in some missing or incorrectly listed publications.</li>
  <li>People who have common names, who published under multiple names or whose articles were written at other institutions are most 
  likely to have incomplete publication lists. </li>
  <li>You can make corrections by manually searching PubMed from within Profiles to add, edit or delete publications. By curating 
  publications manually, you are helping UCSD Profiles to identify which concepts and co-authors are correctly associated with your 
  profile, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the right publications on subsequent attempts. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage">Who manages UCSD Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCSD Profiles is managed by the UC San Diego
<a href="https://actri.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI)</a>.</li>
