 API QUICKSTART
========================================================================

The API reference is very complete but also very general. The following 
describes some simple URLs for retrieving basic user and publication 
data that can be used with commandline tools such as curl.

    curl -k -u ucb:PASSWORD https://qa-oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu:8002/elements-secure-api/publications?userid=11229

Also, if you have the 'xmllint' tool it can be used to format and 
indent the output to make it more readable, e.g.

    curl -k -u ucb:PASSWORD https://qa-oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu:8002/elements-secure-api/publications?userid=11229 | xmllint --format - | more

* URL to search for a user by their Shibboleth EPPN:

    https://qa-oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu:8002/elements-secure-api/users?username=eabel@berkeley.edu

    in there you can find their id number within Elements, e.g. in this 
    case, we see:
     <api:object category="user" id="11229" proprietary-id="011460066"...>
    and so the user id is 11229.

* List items for a given user once you have their userid:

    https://qa-oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu:8002/elements-secure-api/publications?userid=11229

* If you already have a publication's Elements ID, you can get the 
  record for just that publication:

    https://qa-oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu:8002/elements-secure-api/publications/1386708
