<h3 id="who">Who is listed in UCLA Profiles?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UCLA Profiles was created for research networking so we initially focused on adding UCLA faculty members, 
  researchers with academic leadership appointments, and non-faculty academic researchers. </li>
  <li>We are happy to include research staff and other individuals in the UCLA community, on request and if possible. 
  Send requests, with full name and employee ID, to <a href="mailto:profiles@ucla.edu">profiles@ucla.edu</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Who can view UCLA Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCLA Profiles is searchable on the web and can be viewed by the general public as well as the UCLA community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login">How do I sign in to UCLA Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong><a href="../login/default.aspx?method=login&amp;edit=true">Sign in</a></strong> link on any UCLA Profiles page.
  Then enter your single sign on (SSO) username and password.</li>
  <li>If you have never used SSO, or for password support, go to 
  <a href="https://www.it.ucla.edu/services/accounts-access/ucla-logon-id" target="_blank">UCLA Logon ID</a> 
  or contact your Home Departmental Administrator.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="pubs">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile? How can I correct this?</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>UCLA Profiles uses a complex mix of names, institution, and publication information to find your  publications in PubMed's repository. 
  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to  match all articles in PubMed to Profiles authors with complete precision and accuracy. </li>
  <li>People who have common names, who published under multiple names or whose articles were written while at other 
  institutions are most likely to have incomplete publication lists. </li>
  <li>You can make corrections by searching PubMed from within Profiles to add, edit or delete publications. By curating publications 
  manually, you are helping UCLA Profiles to identify which concepts and co-authors are correctly associated with your profile, 
  thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the right publications on subsequent attempts. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage">Who manages UCLA Profiles?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCLA Profiles is managed by the <a href="https://ctsi.ucsf.edu/about-us/programs/research-technology" target="_blank">Research Technology</a> 
  program of UCSF's <a href="http://ctsi.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)</a>.</li>
